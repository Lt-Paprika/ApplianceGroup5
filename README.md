Program uses a Abstract class named Appliance as the base to create four different classes of appliances for a store program.

The store program builds the inventory of each appliance from a list using different identifiers and stores them.
then users can search the inventory based on brand name, or type of appliance, and buy a appliance if it is available and upon exiting the program the inventory is updated and saved for future uses.
